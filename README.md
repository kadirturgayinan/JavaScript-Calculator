# JavaScript-Calculator

Prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation. These steps are performed using the prompt() function.

Convert the user input numbers to floating-point numbers using the parseFloat() function.

Determine the selected operation using a switch-case structure. The user can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division operations.

Perform the selected operation, and assign the result to the variable 'result'.

Print the result to the console using the console.log() function.

This algorithm calculates based on the numbers entered by the user and the type of operation selected. It then displays the result to the user. This simple algorithm forms the foundation of the JavaScript calculator application
